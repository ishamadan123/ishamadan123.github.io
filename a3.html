    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class = "header">
        <p>
            For this assignment, we were tasked to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a sensor <b>(I chose
            to use a photoresistor)</b> in a voltage divider to change the state of an output device. 

            <br><br>
            
            Since the output device could not be just a single LED, I wanted
            to experiment with a new tool in our arduino kit, called the <b>1 digit 7-segment display.</b>
            I thought it would be fun to play around with which LEDs could create letters, numbers, or patterns on this single character display.
            I wanted certain characters to show up depending on the light resistor's sensors.

            <br> <br>

            On the right, you can see the final product where there is a <b>countdown from 3, 2, 1, 0</b> as there is 
            less light around the photoresistor.
        </p>

    <br>

    <h2>The Set Up</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The schematic of the photoresistor is similar to that in class, with the <b>photoresistor connected to power</b> and 
        the <b>second resistor connected to ground</b>. 

        <br> <br>
        
        After researching the schematic of a 1-digit 7 segment display, I used the reference diagram on the very 
        left to separate <b>letters a to g</b> to distinguish each individual LED light display. The second schematic on the right shows 
        all <b>7 LEDs connected to different pins</b> on my arduino board with <b>220 Ohm resistors</b> in between. The display as a whole is connected to ground. 

        <br><br>

        The datasheet for the 7 segment display specifies <b>1.8 voltage drop </b>for the each color LED shown in photos. By using
        the formula <b> V=I*R, </b> the <b>220 Ohm resistors</b> I used for each connection results in about <b>14.54mA</b> current for each.
        This is under the maximum of <b>40mA current</b>, so it is justified. The schematic does not allow for multiple paths of current, 
        since each LED is connected to a different pin.

    </p>

    <h2>Voltage Divider Calculation</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
        The actual values of the <b>voltage divider</b> will depend on the resistance of the 
        photo-resistor (R1) in different lighting conditions. Given the code I wrote below, the 
        minimum and maximum sensor values correspond to the minimum and maximum resistances of the photoresistor. 

        <br> <br>
        
        I checked the data sheet to see that the min/max resistance range of this photoresistor is between 
        <b>0.2M Ohms and 11K Ohms.</b> Now, taking this estimated range into account, I calculated the two extremes 
        of the voltage divider.

        <br> <br>
        
        In my calculations, I estimated a voltage range between <b>0.24V and 2.38V.</b> This is within the typical 
        operating range for an Arduino analog input, thus the <b>10K resistor for R2</b> is a justified choice. This fixed resistor is a 
        standard and commonly available, and also helps keep the power consumption relatively low.

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>Question One</b>
        <br> 
        In my voltage divider, the variable resistor can in fact be either R1 or R2. In the example calculations below, 
        you can see two scenarios where the variable resistor is different every time, which results in different voltage divide values. 
        So, depending on how one wants to design the circuit to perform, either can be used.
        <br> <br>
        <img src="QuestionOne-InputOutput.jpeg" /> 
        <br>
        <b>Question Two</b>
        <br>
        In the GIF up above, it is a total of 4 seconds long. The animation starts with the photoresistor fully exposed to light. Thus, the 
        resistance is low and the voltage drop is high. Then as my hand moves closer to the photoresistor, at around 2 seconds is when it goes completely 
        dark for one second. this means the resistance is high and the voltage drop is low. Then I remove my hand and it goes back tot he original voltage drop.
        <br> <br>
        <img src="QuestionTwo-InputOutput.jpeg" height = "250" /> 
        <br>
        <b>Question Three</b>
        <br>
        To adapt the code for a 10-pit PWM and a 16-bit analog. I would change the map() and analogWrite codes as follows.
        <br>
        <b>sensorValue = map(sensorValue, sensorMin, sensorMax, 0, 65535);</b>
        <br>
        <b>analogWrite(ledPin7, 1023);</b>
        <br>
        <br>

    </p>

    <h2>Code Strategy</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
       In my circuit, I plugged the LED outputs into <b>pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.</b> These all 
       will correspond to the constants I defined and the pins I used <b>analogWrite()</b> on.

       <br> <br>

       The range that the sensor will take in will be from <b>0 to 1023</b> as defined. The <b>analogRead()</b> function
       is used to read the real time sensorValue from the sensor's pin. However, I used the map function 
       to <b>map</b> this range into values of <b>0 to 255</b>. This mapping was useful because I printed the sensorvalue to the Serial, 
       and then played around with my hands covering the resistor. I understood the range of values (between 0 and 255) that 
       associated with different levels of light sensitivity, and used those to identify <b>4 different ranges of sensor values</b>
       that I could use in the <b>if statements</b> to create different LED visuals for each range.

        <code>
          /*
          Input Output Assignment 3
          
          This code begins by calibrating the sensor input. The sensor readings
          during the first five seconds of the sketch execution define the minimum and
          maximum of expected values attached to the sensor pin.
          
          Then, depending on the sensor value, the LED pin confuguration displays numbers counting
          down for 3 to 0, dependent on hand covering the light sensisitve resistor.
