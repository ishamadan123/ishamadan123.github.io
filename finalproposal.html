    <h1>Staying Clean! Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="StayingClean.jpg" height="400" width="500"/>
      <p>
        Project Concept/Motivation: 
        <br>
        “I want to build an hand sanitizer / hand soap dispenser based on the detection of hand movement. Placing this in my room will encourage me to keep my hands clean. I also want a display of how much is left to know when to switch the bottle out ”
        <br><br>
        Anticipated Bill of Materials: 
        <br>
        Arduino Uno
        <br>
        9V Battery (for power supply)
        <br>
        Ultrasonic Sensor (for hand motion)
        <br>
        Servo Motor (for press mechanic)
        <br>
        Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)
        <br>
        LCD Display (quantity left)
        <br>
        3D printed (physical prototype)
        <br><br>
        Timeline and contingency plans:
        <br>
        2/26: Plan the circuit and work on code
        <br>
        2.27 Build circuit
        <br>
        2/28: Continue building + ask questions 
        <br>
        2/29: work on physical prototype
        <br>
        3/1: add LCD display
        <br>
        3/2 - 3/4: create presentation
