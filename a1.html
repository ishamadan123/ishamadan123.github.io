    <h1>Assignment 1: Blink</h1>

      <p>
        For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a schematic for at least 
        3 LEDs connected to the Arduino, which I then implemented as a circuit on my breadboard.
        <br> <br>
        I used the following calculation to decide the resistors to use: V(Volts) = I (Amperes) * R (Ohms)
        <br> <br>
        The voltage of the Arduino is <b>5V</b>, and each LED light I chose to use 
        (red, yellow, and red) each had a voltage drop of <b>1.8V</b> and a desired current of <b>20mA.</b>
        Since this circuit is in <b>parallel</b>, we only need to use to voltage of a single LED.
        <br><br>
        (5-1.8) = 0.02A * R 
        <br>
        3.2 = 0.02 * R
        <br>
        R = 3.2 / 0.02
        <br>
       <b> R = 160 Ohms </b>
       <br> <br>
        I chose to use three <b>220 Ohms resistor</b>  instead of 160, because it just had to be greater than 
        150, and might effect the brightness of the light, but would still function.

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>
      Number 1: 
      <img src="Graph.jpg" height="200" width="300"/>
      <br>
      Number 2: 
      <br>
      14 LEDs for 14 pins that can connect to the Arduino. The calculation is 14 times 0.02A
      which is the current for each LED. This totals to <b>0.28A</b>
      <br> <br>
      Number 3: 
      <br>
      15 seconds (milli) entered into the code was when I could still see the lights blinking. once
      I brought it down to 10 I could no longer see them blinking and it looked like lights on.
