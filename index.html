        Hi, I'm Isha Madan! <br> <br> I'm a senior in HCDE and also pursuing a business minor. I spend most of 
        my time on a dance team at UW, and also enjoy painting and drawing in my free time. I also have a 2 year 
        old labradoodle I miss every day that I'm away from home in Dallas, Texas. <br> <br>
        I am interested in customer experience design and product design so I am excited for to go beyond 2D design in this 
        class and learn how to connect a lot of skills I've learned throughout college so far!

        <p> At the press of a button, one LED fades while the other two turn on. </p>

        <p> As a photoresistor experiences bright light to darkness at the move of my hand, 
          the LED light displays a countdown.
