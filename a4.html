    <h1>Assignment 4: Libraries</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        For this assignment, we were tasked to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses parts from the kit that require a library. It needed to include both an
        input part and an output part.
        <br> <br>
        I chose to create a project with a <b>joystick</b> and <b>keypad</b> (inputs), as well as a <b>servo</b> and <b>LED lights</b> (outputs). The overall
        system came together with a fake door I created, where the joystick and keypad were different ways to lock (close) and unlock (open) the door (servo). 
        The lights also corresponded to the lock position of the door.

    <h2>The Schematic</h2>

    <div class="header">
      <img src="Schematic_Libraries.jpeg" />
      <p>
        The datasheet for green and red LED lights specify a <b>1.8 voltage drop.</b> By using the formula <b>V=I*R,</b> where V = 5 - 1.8 and R = 220 Ohms, 
        the current results in about <b>14.54mA</b> for each. This is under the maximum of <b>30mA current max for LEDs</b>, so the resistor choice is justified.

        <br><br>
        Using the specifications for the membrane keypad, I learned about the division of columns and rows that associated with each possible
        pin connection on this tool. In the code below, you can see the mapping of <b>rows to pins 6-8</b>, and <b>columns to pins 2-5</b>. 

        <br><br>
        For the joystick, I only used the <b>x-axis values</b> in my code structure, and didn't use a SW pin, thus I only had three connections. The joystick 
        was used as an analog input as the VRX was connected to <b>pin A1</b>. Lastly, the servo motor was attached the <b>pin 11</b>.

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>Question One</b>
      <br>
      Below is the graph example for a servo motor at pin 9 with the following code: <b>for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);} </b>
      Essentially, given the documetation of <b>20ms PWM period</b> for a servo motor that has different duty cycles depending on the 
      angle and also a <b>delay of 100ms</b> in the code, a rectangle like structure is drawn on repeat. Within 2 seconds, I estimated how many times the code would loop 
      and it may not be drawn to exact scale.
      <br> <br>
      <img src="QuestionOne_Libraries.jpeg" />
      <br><br>
      <b>Question Two</b>
      <br> 
      If my input device is leading to erroneous readings 1% of the time, the best way to address this is to <b>not include those erroneous values.</b> 
      A pseudocode description of fixing this is written below. 
      <br> 
      1. Collect input readings from the input device based on a calibration mapping system
      <br>
      2. Create an if statement that catches erroneous values outside of the calibration range values
      <br>
      3. Once caught, either re-assign the erroneous input value to a max or min within the accepted range 
      depending on what the value is, or discard the value by resetting the loop and reading the next input value.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <b>Question Two</b>
      <br> 
      If my input device is slightly noisy, the best way to address this is by identifying whether the value is up or down by 10%, and <b>filtering
      it to a more reliable measurement value.</b> A pseudocode description of fixing this is written below. 
      <br> 
      1. Collect input readings from the input device based on a calibration system, identifying the max and min values.
      <br>
      2. Monitors the incoming measurements and check if they deviate more than a certain threshold (which can be set to 10%). This 
      can be marked as potentially noisy.
      <br>
      3. Either disregard the noisy value if there is reason to believe it is too far an outlier, or replace it with a filtered value. 
      This new value replacement can be a compromise between the original value and a more reliable estimate.
        
       
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Code Strategy</h2>
    <br>
    Functionally, I wanted to be able to enter a pin code into the keypad to open the door. I assigned an <b>array password value</b> at the top of the code 
    that is used to check off of later as the keypad inputs are taken in. I made sure to include a calibration of the joystick, moving it 
    along to the x-axis to define max and min values, mapping them from <b>0 to 1023</b>. Then, I set a range of above 800 or below 200 for the joystick motion to 
    open and close the door (ie move the servo). The lights were a fun addition to also indicate the movements of the servo motor.

    I originally had it all in the loop method, but decided to split off <b>two separate methods</b> for the joystick calibration and also to move the servo and trun on 
    the respective light. I felt that this helped my code feel and look cleaner. 
    The <b>use of the Serial</b> was also helpful to identify different steps in the process and also make sure the code was picking up on the 
    keypad and joystick values the way I wanted it to.

            This code begins by calibrating the joystick input. The sensor readings
            during the first five seconds of the sketch execution define the minimum and
            maximum of expected values attached to the sensor pin.
                      
            Then, the joystick can be used to move a servo back and forth (opening and closing the door).
            Alterhanitvely, the door has a "passocde." When this passcode is entered into the keypad, the door opens.
            The closes at the press of * or #.
