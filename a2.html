    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For this assignment, we were tasked to create a schematic, circuit, and code 
      that uses several LEDs, a button, tilt switch, or a switch I make myself, a for-loop, 
      digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), and analogWrite(). Document your project on your webpage.
      <br> <br>
      I chose to use <b> three LED lights (one green, two yellow), and one button.</b>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>The Set Up</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      I created a plan for my circuit using both a schematic drawing as well as visualizing
      the wire connections before creating it on my breadboard.

          Fade Assignment Code 
        
          Turns on and off three light emitting diodes(LED) connected to digital pins. One of these
          three pins will fade in and out instead of turning on. When the button is not pushed, all 
          of the lights will turn off.

              }

            } else {
              // the following happens when the pushbutton state isn't pressed, ie is LOW
