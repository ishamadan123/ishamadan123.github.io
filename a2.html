    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For this assignment, we were tasked to create a schematic, circuit, and code 
      that uses several LEDs, a button, tilt switch, or a switch I make myself, a for-loop, 
      digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), and analogWrite(). Document your project on your webpage.
      <br> <br>
      I chose to use <b> three LED lights (one green, two yellow), and one button.</b>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>The Set Up</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      I created a plan for my circuit using both a schematic drawing as well as visualizing
      the wire connections before creating it on my breadboard.

      <br> <br> 
      As you can see on the left photo below, I chose <b>10K Ohms</b> for the resistor on my switch circuit,
      and <b>220 Ohms</b> for each LED light resistor. The 220 Ohms resistor produces a current of <b>14.54 mA</b> for 
      each pinâ€™s circuit, which is within the max current specification for green and yellow LED lights. Additionally, 
      the <b>10K Ohms</b> resistor produces a current of 0.5mA. The reason I chose this resistor for the pull-down 
      switch is because Arduino documentation recommends this value for digital input pins.

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For Question #1, I drew a straight line at <b>5V</b> to represent the analogwrite at 255, which represents
      the LED light being always on. 128 is about half of 255, meaning the voltage of that analog write will be around <b>2.5V</b>. 
      With a similar calculation method, 64 is one-fourth of 255, meaning the voltage of that analog write will be around <b>1.25</b>.
      I followed the pulse width modulation graphing methods with a <b>50% duty cycle</b> and <b>25% duty cycle</b>.
      <br> <br>
      For Question #2, I used a formula to calculate the runtime in hours. Since I used <b>220 Ohm</b> resistors on each of 
      my 3 LEDs, I calculated the total forward current to be <b>43.62mA</b>. I continued (as seen below) to calculate the final runtime of 
      <b>27.51</b> hours with the given battery capacity.

        <code>
          /*
          Fade Assignment Code 
        
          Turns on and off three light emitting diodes(LED) connected to digital pins. One of these
          three pins will fade in and out instead of turning on. When the button is not pushed, all 
          of the lights will turn off.

                delay(30); // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
              }
              // for the 3rd LED, fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points

                delay(30); // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
              }
          
            } else {
              // the following happens when the pushbutton state isn't pressed, ie is LOW
              digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn first LED off
